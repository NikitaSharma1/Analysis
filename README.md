# Sales Trend Analysis of XYZ TRADERS 
## About XYZ Traders:
XYZ traders is a kitchenware shop registered on April 20, 2018 and located in West Delhi, Delhi, 
India. They buy products from various wholesalers whenever required and then sell it further. 
They own a warehouse to store extra goods. <br>
## Target of the analysis:
To come up with ideas which will lead to rise in sales.<br>
## About data collection:
I requested my friend to share as much data as he can of his father’s shop for the analysis 
purpose, so, he gave me an old data from April 2019 to Feb 2020. The only condition was to 
maintain anonymity, so I have changed the shop’s name and their distributer. <br>
## Analysis:
 ### Sales Trend analysis 
‒ Monthly Sales Trend analysis from April 2019 to Feb 2020 to check the month with 
highest sales and then Daily sales trend analysis of that month to find the reason 
behind it.<br>
‒ Constructed table to find out the unsold products and the reason behind it.<br>
‒ Figured out the product with highest margin(sale price - purchase price)<br>
‒ Plotted cumulative revenue and cumulative quantity to find out the highest selling 
product and the one contributing the most in the revenue.<br>
‒ Found out the most preferable sellers and how the purchases are distributed.<br>
## Recommendation:
‒ Switch to cash register so that the data of sales and purchase can be stored efficiently 
and it will become easy to check the remaining stock. Because the reason behind the 
purchase of goods again before selling them was either the bill receipt got lost or 
product was misplaced.<br>
‒ Provide small discounts or schemes especially in the months before Dhanteras to 
increase the sales and build good customer bond which might make them come again 
on Dhanteras.
